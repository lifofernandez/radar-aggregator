I donât know if thereâs a comic, book, film, or any other piece of art that better captures a childhood. I read every Sunday strip, most of the dailies, and the ones that I missed I would read in dog-eared collection books checked out from the library. As I got older, I wanted to know more about the stripâs creation. When I picked up the <em>Complete Calvin and Hobbes</em>, a 14-pound tomb, I was a little disappointed. Other than an introduction, there was very little information about the mysterious creator Bill Watterson. Thankfully, <em>Exploring Calvin and Hobbes: An Exhibition Catalogue</em> makes up for that. \r\n\r\n</p><p>This is the Blu-Ray extras that <em>Calvin & Hobbes</em> fans have been waiting for. Itâs not for those casually interested in reading the strip. There are plenty of other books for that. But if youâre interested in process, history, and the inspiration behind a boy and his tiger, youâre going to love this book. \r\n\r\n</p><p>The book explores an exhibit of Wattersonâs work at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Museum. It also includes one of the most in-depth interviews heâs ever given. In it you get a rare look at his early work, the tools Watterson used, the struggles he went through, and the wonderful comic that he created. You get a real sense of the artistry that Watterson put into the strip, and how it evolved over the years. Itâs great to relive and learn about something that had such an influence on me. This book is definitely a must-have for <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> fans. \r\n\r\n<em>â JP LeRoux</em></p>",

(I have a real <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006HUQZ6/boingboing\">red stapler</a>, too.)\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, I've tried to keep my Moka in pristine condition, but my family members don't care about it as much as I do. They would leave it on the burner after the water boiled up from the lower chamber to the upper chamber, which caused the bottom part to overheat and turn black. \r\n\r\n<p>The final straw dropped on Saturday when one of my family members forgot to put water in it *and* forgot about it on the burner. I was in another room and when I smelled burning plastic, I knew what had happened. I ran into the kitchen and grabbed the handle with a dish rag. It stretched like taffy. Even the plastic knob on the lid was melted. Disgusted, I threw  the coffee maker in the trash. \r\n\r\n<p>An hour later I pulled it out of the trash. I decided I could make a new handle. That was a good idea, but I idiotically thought I could get away with making a handle on a 3D printer. I <a href=\"https://tinkercad.com/things/j4UmH44PXg4\">designed the handle</a> on Tinkercad (a fantastic web-based 3D modeling application):\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/t725-9.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>I also designed a knob for the lid. It took about an hour to print out both pieces. While it was printing, I used a Dremel tool to remove the carbonized black stuff off of alternating facets of the octagonal boiler chamber. I was pleased with my new orange/green/black/silver Moka and posted a photo of it to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/frauenfelder/\">my Instagram feed</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"6\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFIWLixie-3/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">The espresso maker that wouldn't die.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Mark Frauenfelder (@frauenfelder) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-05-08T03:00:57+00:00\">May 7, 2016 at 8:00pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<p>A few minutes later, I tried making coffee with it and the handle melted immediately. What was I thinking? I guess I'd hoped the water in the boiler would absorb the heat so the handle wouldn't get hot enough to melt. Live and learn.\r\n\r\n<p>As a believer in the sunk cost fallacy, I didn't want to give up on making this thing work. I found a little bamboo cutting board that we don't use much (part of a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MI6GQFW/boingboing\">3-piece set</a> I bought last year). I eyeballed a pencil outline for the handle on the board and cut it on a bandsaw. I made a knob from a scrap of 0.75-inch square lumber. The whole process took less than 20 minutes. I like the finished result so much that now I'm happy my family member melted the handle and knob.

It not only let me exercise my imagination but also supplied me with some of the happiest memories as I watched it with my family. After re-watching \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I decided to use this as a chance to create a homage in the form of a title sequence. This would also serve as my senior \"thesis\" at SVA and took me the whole semester to complete.<P>\r\nThe style and tone of the animation was inspired by the James Bond title sequences. The music was a rejected song from the newest Bond film, Spectre, sung by Radiohead. I really wanted to play on the concept of Luke trying to find himself and true purpose, so the music and inspiration felt fitting.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<img src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/screenshot-6.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"903\" height=\"416\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-460987\" />\r\n<P>\r\n<img src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/screenshot-7-930x417.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"930\" height=\"417\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460988\" />"

Other Music was a hub of avant-garde culture both locally and via their phenomenal weekly newsletter reviewing new releases, from experimental electronica to post-punk indie to freaky psych reissues, and everywhere in between. Whenever I visited Manhattan, I made a beeline to Other Music, and loved hearing staff recommendations (and peeking at what other customers were buying).\r\n<P>\r\nâWe still do a ton of business â probably more than most stores in the country,â co-owner Josh Madell told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/arts/music/other-music-record-store-closing.html?_r=1&mc_cid=44f568c7b7&mc_eid=e08c8ebff8\">New York Times</a>. âItâs just the economics of it actually supporting us â we donât see a future in it. Weâre trying to step back before it becomes a nightmare.â\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><P>Business has dropped by half since the storeâs peak in 2000, when it did about $3.1 million in sales, said Chris Vanderloo, who founded the shop with Mr. Madell and Jeff Gibson after the three met as employees at the music spinoff of Kimâs Video in the early â90s. (Mr. Gibson left Other Musicâs day-to-day operations in 2001.)\r\n<P>\r\nRent, on the other hand, has more than doubled from the $6,000 a month the store paid in 1995, while its annual share of the buildingâs property tax bill has also increased with the local real estate market.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOther Music, I will miss you. <p>\r\n"

This year, that pace has accelerated. There have been at least 23 toddler-involved shootings since Jan. 1, compared with 18 over the same period last year.

States with lax ones see lots of toddler shootings; even states with high levels of gun violence in general see few toddler gun injuries when they enact such laws. The NRA <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/19991005/the-hidden-agenda-behind-gun-storage-la\">claims gun storage laws are an attack on individual liberty</a>, and it not only opposes them but <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2016/01/07/nra-says-it-will-sue-oakland-over-new-gun-laws\">sues city governments that enact them</a>.",

This was apparently an issue of individuals working on their own initiative rather than the result of corporate policy, but they <em>were</em> directed to squelch news about Facebook itself and to manually inject \"missing\" stories into the trending topics.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>These new allegations emerged after Gizmodo last week revealed details about the inner workings of Facebookâs trending news teamâa small group of young journalists, primarily educated at Ivy League or private East Coast universities, who curate the âtrendingâ module on the upper-right-hand corner of the site. As we reported last week, curators have access to a ranked list of trending topics surfaced by Facebookâs algorithm, which prioritizes the stories that should be shown to Facebook users in the trending section. The curators write headlines and summaries of each topic, and include links to news sites. The section, which launched in 2014, constitutes some of the most powerful real estate on the internet and helps dictate what news Facebookâs usersâ167 million in the US aloneâare reading at any given moment.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Facebook's \"trending\" stuff comes out of a newsroom-like culture, with editorial direction and values. Which would be fine, except for the fact that Facebook claims that its trending topics are an organic or algorithmic representation of user interests and activities. Other Facebook curators Gizmodo spoke to denied that they suppressed conservative viewpoints, and \"we were unable to determine if left-wing news topics or sources were similarly suppressed.\"\r\n\r\n<p>Managers also instructed them to insert stories that were not trending despite being in the news; the Charlie Hebdo attacks, for instance, failed to trend on Facebook until it was artificially promoted, according to Gizmodo's source."

With all the electronics packed into todayâs automobiles, itâs virtually impossible for the layman to diagnose his own car problems anymore. Avoid that uncertainty with the FIXD Active Car Health Monitor, now </span><a href=\"https://store.boingboing.net/sales/fixd-active-car-health-monitor?utm_source=boingboing.net&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fixd-active-car-health-monitor_050916\">just $38.95</span></a> in the Boing Boing Store.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXD is a small sensor that plugs easily into practically any vehicle manufactured after 1996. Once it syncs via Bluetooth to your smartphone, FIXD can assess any check engine light that pops up, then translate it into simple terms for non-gearheads to tell you exactly how seriously you need to take your car problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than worrying about your vehicleâs safety or a huge mechanicâs bill, FIXD will ease your anxiety by letting you know whatâll happen if you keep driving with the problem and what repairs need to happen to get your car or truck back in tip-top shape. FIXD can even turn off your check engine light, a procedure that previously could only be handled by an auto repair professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even without concerning warning lights, FIXD keeps helping, tracking and alerting you when your vehicle needs scheduled maintenance. This unit also lets you remotely monitor all your family vehicles so youâll always have peace of mind knowing the wife and kids are all driving safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get the FIXD Active Car Health Monitor now at </span><a href=\"https://store.boingboing.net/sales/fixd-active-car-health-monitor?utm_source=boingboing.net&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fixd-active-car-health-monitor_050916\">20% off</span></a> its regular price.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKNiNPEwjD4&w=560&h=315]</span></p>",
