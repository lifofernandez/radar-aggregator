And while such ideas have been around as long as computer graphics, consumer tech is finally catching up with the vision. Here’s the thing: now as we move from sci-fi to reality, it’s not totally clear what this tech is for. Sure, it’s fun for immersive games, but beyond that? One way to find out: try it yourself.

It's more of an avoid-em-up that has you navigating its single-screen levels while avoiding collisions with the oddly shaped wildlife. </p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, you're not entirely helpless. A tail made out of bullets trails behind you, killing everything it comes in contact with. The only way to progress is to fulfill your kill quota, so you have to aggressively dodge and swerve around your foes, which is very challenging indeed. Enemy spawners can be eliminated by looping around them, and hitting a certain kind of enemy charges a powerful, one-shot laser beam that can help you out of a tight spot. You need to be constantly on the move or it's game over.</p><p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nR3N9mYS8ik\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Pan-Dimensional Conga Combat is an excellent, quirky little game that can feel pretty punishing at first, but it has a lot to offer with with an arcade, endless, and even local multiplayer mode. It is also asking for some <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680135447\">Greenlight</a> love, so go ahead and give it a thumbs up if you like trippy arena shooters.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pan-Dimensional Conga Combat is available for $4.99 on <a href=\"https://rgcddev.itch.io/conga-combat\">itch.io</a> or <a href=\"http://gamejolt.com/games/pan-dimensional-conga-combat/146129\">Gamejolt</a>.

Doctors were able to separate the two, and the woman was released into the wild.\r\n<p>\r\nVia The Hamilton Spectator:\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Paramedics in Boca Raton rushed a beachgoer to the hospital with a two-foot-long nurse shark clinging to her arm after efforts to disengage it failed.\r\n<P>\r\nBob Lemons, spokesperson for the Boca Raton Fire Rescue, said the 23-year-old woman was already out of the water when rescuers reached the beach. The dead shark was hanging from her arm.\r\n<p>\r\n\"She was sitting calmly, seemed to handle it pretty well,\" Lemons told USA Today.

But there's hope!\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>\r\nAcross the West, people are still choosing to walk. Nearly every journey in the UK involves a little walking, and nearly a quarter of all journeys are made entirely on foot, according to one survey. But the same study found that a mere 17% of trips were \"just to walk\". And that included dog-walking.\r\nIt is that \"just to walk\" category that is so beloved of creative thinkers.<p>\r\n\"There is something about the pace of walking and the pace of thinking that goes together. Walking requires a certain amount of attention but it leaves great parts of the time open to thinking. I do believe once you get the blood flowing through the brain it does start working more creatively,\" says Geoff Nicholson, author of The Lost Art of Walking.<p>\r\n\"Your senses are sharpened. As a writer, I also use it as a form of problem solving. I'm far more likely to find a solution by going for a walk than sitting at my desk and 'thinking'.\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I suspect there is an element of benign self-deception in the idea of a purposeless walk. I walked a lot when I lived in the city, apparently without purpose, but there was concealed purpose in the rhythms and pressures of urban living. You walk to manage your environment, even when there is no destination. Walkable cities subtly help you do this.\r\n\r\n<p>If the \"purposeless walk\" seems unattainable or irrelevant, well, it might simply be because your environment doesn't permit it. I'm not saying you have to leave LA or anything, but we do get to pick our priorities.",

Nash\r\n\r\n<br>Abrams ComicArts\r\n\r\n<br>2009, 304 pages, 8.6 x 9.2 x 1.1 inches \r\n\r\n<br>$29 <a class=\"amazon-button\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/081095303X/thebooklab-20\">Buy a copy on Amazon</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Manga Kamishibai</em> tells and shows the fascinating history of Japanese paper theater, a lost storytelling form and the link between Edo-era Japanese <em>ukiyo-e</em> prints and modern day manga and television. I say âand showsâ because this art form combined the spoken word with compelling visuals in uniquely Japanese storytelling performances and this book is rich with many wonderful reproductions of the hand-painted artwork.\r\n \r\n</p><p>Picture this: In devastated post-WWII Tokyo, a man stops his bicycle on a street corner. On the back of his bike is mounted a large, sixty-pound wooden box. The man flips a few panels around to reveal a stage-like picture frame. He noisily clacks together two wooden sticks, <em>hiyogoshi</em>, to call the neighborhood children. As they gather to see and hear the free show, the man sells them home-made penny candies, including a not-too-sweet taffy thatâs pulled and stretched using a chopstick (like todayâs movie business, the real money is in the profitable concessions!). The paying customers get a front row seat to the performance. The man slides a sequence of large, colorful panels in the frame âscreenâ as he tells adventure stories, quizzes the audience, and weaves tales of suspense, all with character voices and sound effects. As the story ends on a dramatic, to-be-continued cliff-hanger, the man packs up his two-wheel theater and pedals away ... until next time. They are all but vanished now, but these performances date back to the 1930s when 2,500 <em>kamishibaiya</em> in Tokyo alone entertained 1 million kids a day.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Any fan of manga, anime, as well as comics in general will devour this book. The reproductions of the lurid images of action heroes, monsters, villains, and damsels in distress in the stories embody a potent mix of influences: Japanese ink brush work, movie posters, silent film and cinematic design, and plenty of Western references. The army of artists that painted these panels freely borrowed from many genres, from Betty Boop to folk tales. In turn, kamishibai set the stage for the manga and anime that took its place (many of the same artists moved along with them). As the advent of television made these live street performances obsolete (television was first called <em>denki kamishibai</em>, or âelectric paper theaterâ), the artists lifted from popular TV shows for their dying art form. Holy copy-cat, Batman!\r\n\r\n</p><p>Youâll enjoy the witty captions, wideâranging historical references and the clever writing style. This book also shows and tells how kamishibai was used to disseminate news, spread propaganda, illustrate war survival techniques, and fight prejudices. In a parallel to the congressional hearings and criticism by Wertham of the U.S. comic makers, kamishibai also was investigated and regulated. Youâll read (and see) other interesting facts, like the technological and historical reason why comics have always been an important media form in Japan. (Hint: what if your language doesnât suit itself to using Gutenbergâs movable type?). <em>Manga Kamishibai</em> is a real treat for any fan of Japanese pop culture (candy not included).",

Itâs a relationship of toxic codependency. Activists need the media to help spread the word, even as it pumps out sexist stereotypes; the media, meanwhile, cannot risk losing touch with the zeitgeist. In her introduction, Zeisler describes her book as âan exploration of how the new embrace of marketplace feminism â mediated, decoupled from politics, staunchly focused on individual experience and actualization â dovetails with entrenched beliefs about power, about activism, about who feminists are and what they do.â</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Penny writes that things have become more nuanced, less monolithic, and that feminists are one again engaging the in the \"time-honored tradition\" of being too hard on their own movement -- and especially on grassroots creativity that's succeeded despite media indifference.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Granted, as she points out, this newfound feminist populism hasnât stopped the relentless conservative assault on abortion rights in the United States. Given the tireless work of abortion rights activists, however, perhaps itâs time we stopped blaming feminists for that and started blaming Republicans. The womenâs movement has always been good at rebuking itself for every imperfection. The âconfidenceâ promised by Dove body lotion may not be the revolution we have waited for â but feminism could use a little more faith in itself.\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes we donât know when weâre winning. \r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>When Miley Cyrus described herself as pansexual, I thought it was awesome but that it presented a similar \"semiotic\" dilemma where everyone's constantly thinking about what it all means rather than what was said. Celebrity self-presentation as queer is easily understood as performance and often assumed to be a cynical commercial act. But it's also worthy in its own right, even if untrue, as an act of affirmation: an empowered willingness to broaden and define our identities irrespective of traditional standards and values, to whatever ends suit the willing. I still can't decide if I think it's bullshit or not, but the point is maybe that <em>no-one should care what I think</em> in the first place.\r\n\r\n<p>As of press time, Google will reply \"Liam Hemsworth\" if you ask it who Miley Cyrus's girlfriend is."

It's easy to see why: there's rarely been a more likable cast of characters in kids' comic history, each one with her own distinctive personality, quirks and challenges. They're variously gonzo, timid, adventurous, fearless, cunning, and hilarious, and their friendships leap off the page to skewer the reader's heart.\r\n<p>\r\nThe first two books tell a single long story that introduces the many Lumberjanes mysteries -- and the many badges that a Lumberjane can earn during her summers at camp. The third book is an anthology that features guest contributions from some of my favorite comics creators, like the incredible <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/?s=%22faith%20erin%20hicks%22\">Faith Erin Hicks</a>, whose affection for this story shines out like a lighthouse beam (specifically, like the beam of the enchanted lighthouse in the first two books).\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WLB007MIGE_Lumberjanes-Denim-Jacket_PAIR-1000x1000.jpg\" align=\"right\">\r\nThe comic has moved from strength to strength during its run, sensitively and intelligently tackling one character's trans identity and a romance between two others, in a way that's both sweet and age-appropriate for the youngest readers of the series (Boom Box, the publisher, rates it for eight and up).\r\n<p>\r\nWhat's more, the creators are building out a huge, satisfying world with many well-drawn peripheral characters (I want to go to a camp with counselors like the ones we only meet for a panel or two in book three!). It's no wonder that the comic has spawned such a huge fandom, producing their own Lumberjanes merit badges (which you can wear on this official <a href=\"http://www.welovefine.com/lumberjanes-denim-jacket-10259.html\">$48 Lumberjanes denim jacket</a>).\r\n<p>\r\nAlways fast-paced, always funny, <em>Lumberjanes</em> nevertheless is a story about characters, about intense friendship, and about overcoming personal challenges with help from your friends. \r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1WyKSJm\">Lumberjanes Vol. 1: Beware The Kitten Holy </a> [Noelle Stevenson, Brooke A Allen, Shannon Watters/Boom Box]\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1TDL82W\">Lumberjanes Vol. 2: Friendship To The Max</a> [Noelle Stevenson, Brooke A Allen, Shannon Watters/Boom Box]\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1sps4zz\">Lumberjanes Vol. 3: A Terrible Plan</a> [Noelle Stevenson, Brooke A Allen, Shannon Watters/Boom Box]\r\n",
