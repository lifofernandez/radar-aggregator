Scarface has been entertaining photographers, non-threateningly, for decades. It seems unlikely he was killed in self-defense, as he was unlikely to disturb family pic-a-nics. \r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/05/06/scarface-famous-yellowstone-grizzly-shot-dead-twilight-years-164401\">ICTMN</a> shares:\r\n<p>\r\n<blockquote><p>In the ongoing research into the habits of the grizzlies in Yellowstone, Scarface had been captured, collared, and released 17 times.\r\n<p>\r\nScarface did survive to a ripe old age for his species, 25. In his prime, he weighed 600 pounds. He was down to 338 pounds and biologists expected this last winter to be his last. They meant a death from old age, not from gunshots. Social media were full of outrage from biologists and wildlife photographers, for whom Scarface had become a symbol of the species struggling for survival against climate change and the invasion of bear habitat by humans.\r\n<p>\r\nShooting a grizzly is unlawful except in self-defense, but Scarface had a long history with people that made him an unlikely candidate to attack a photographer or a hunter. Because of the Endangered Species Act violation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has opened an investigation into the circumstances of the shooting. Several photographers, decrying the shooting, declared that Scarface was the most photographed bear in Yellowstone.\r\n<p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n",

Vancouver humans are under attack by aggressive crows. Jim O'Leary, an instructor at Langara College, has developed <a href=\"http://giscourses.net/crowtrax/crowtrax.html\">an interactive map of the attacks</a>, but as yet offers no explanation for the aggressive birds.\r\n<p>\r\nVia <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/british-columbia/crow-attack-map-1.3567485\">the CBC website</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\"You could go out on the street and you could see the crows, literally, coming and hitting people on the head.\"\r\n<p>\r\nO'Leary hopes his map will reveal some patterns in where crows attack. For instance, it is already showing that a large number of the attacks happen in the West End and downtown of Vancouver, which makes sense, he says, because crows love to be around human food, and those areas have lots of restaurants and leafy trees.\r\n<p>\r\nThe map has already gotten about 300 attacks recorded in it, and O'Leary wants to see more.\r\n<p>\r\nO'Leary, however, hasn't added to any of that data, because he hasn't been attacked himself.\r\n<p>\r\n\"I'm careful, and I have a little umbrella that I put behind me,\" he said.<p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n(<em>Thanks, Russell Smalley!</em>)",

Eerie fragments of fiction hide among commonplace online discussion. Sometimes readers reply and engage, and sometimes are none the wiser. The enthusiastic cult fandom <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/9M9H9E9/wiki/index\">quickly built a Wiki</a> to study and catalogue the mysterious tale, create a timeline of known events, and to note in a sort of literary formalist way what tropes the author is employing. The story also has its own <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/9m9h9e9\">dedicated discussion thread</a> where volunteers have even developed audiobook editions.\r\n<p>\r\nThe internet has always loved a good mystery, and Wikis, message boards and image boards have a history of playing host to fascinating and often scary folktales that leverage the format and utility of these digital spaces in creative ways.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We can only hope,\" she adds, \"that it's not a viral marketing stunt.\" ",

This clip begins after Leno interviewed Burt Reynolds, who is sitting to the left of an empty chair reserved for the next guest, Marc Summers (host of Nickelodeon's game show <em>Double Dare</em>). Before Summers comes out, Leno shows a scene from <em>Double Dare</em> where Summers gets repeatedly hit by pies from some kind of pie throwing machine.\r\n\r\n<p>Leno asks him about it, and Summers says that it is weird for him to be the host of a messy show because he is a \"neatness freak.\" (Summers has OCD) For some reason, that strikes a nerve with Reynolds, who starts making sourfaced verbal jabs. Summers makes a crack about still being married (Reynolds had just gone through a messy divorce with Loni Anderson) and Reynolds grabs a mug of water and tosses it on Summers. It goes downhill from there. Leno does nothing to stop it because he knows good TV when he sees it. \r\n\r\n<p>If you want to know the backstory (and it's fascinating to hear Summers describe it), here's <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=0874779901&standardNoType=1&excerpt=true\">the chapter about the incident</a> from Summers' book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585420484/boingboing\">Everything In its Place: My Trials and Triumphs with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</a>. \r\n\r\n<p><em>[<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscureMedia/comments/4i0vpt/marc_summers_host_of_nickelodeons_game_show/\">via</a>]</em>",

If renting an apartment is not for you, and you want a small house for less than $40k, then chances are itâs going to be a so-called â<a href=\"http://thetinylife.com/what-is-the-tiny-house-movement/\">tiny house</a>.â These are typically 50 to 400 square feet and most often use a compost or chemical toilet (or, god forbid the smell, an incinerator toilet).\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"attachment-266x266 size-266x266 alignright\" src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tiny-House-in-Portland-300x452.jpg\" alt=\"Tiny House in Portland\" width=\"177\" height=\"266\" />Here (right) is a photo of a typical tiny house from Wikipedia.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nPeople think this is a new thing. While the reason people may be building and living in houses the size of a single room in a home may vary (âI want to downsize,â âI can make do with less,â âWho can afford a regular size house?â âMy wife and kids drive me nuts!â), the fact is that people have been living in eensy-weensy domiciles for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n<p>I suppose we could start with the cave, and the caveman and woman, but thatâs silly. They didnât even know about toilet paper.\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1800s, as the migration toward the western part of the U.S. began in earnest:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stumphouse.jpg\" alt=\"stumphouse\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1099\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-460641\" />\r\n\r\n<p>As the first waves of loggers swept over great portions of the Pacific Northwest's old-growth forests in the second half of the nineteenth century, those men opened up the dark dense woodlands to settlement. â¦. Left behind was a scarred landscape, scrap wood, and stumps. Many stumps. Huge stumps. Stumps that still stood a full 10 feet high but were undesirable as lumber because they tended to swell down toward their base, making the wood-grain uneven. \r\n\r\n<p>When subsequent waves of pioneer settlers came on through, they found those old logging sites to be welcome clearings that hinted at possible futures as rich farmland. But, being littered with debrisâand those towering stumpsâthese homesteads presented the challenge of years' worth of hard labor just to clear (by burning and digging-out stumps) enough proper space to plant orchards or raise crops or livestock.\r\n\r\n<p>For select stumps would-be farmers found other uses â¦ By constructing roofs on them and attaching a door or gate the stump-based shelters worked fine as storage sheds or chicken houses, or pens to keep pigs and calves safe from prowling predators including raccoons, bobcats, or \r\nbears. And sometimes it was people who were the denizens of these stump houses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stumphouse1-600x424.jpg aligncenter\" style=\"width:100%\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1847 the pioneering McAllister family moved northward to the Medicine Creek area (near Nisqually). It was there that they set up shelter by hollowing out a stump and making a âHome Sweet Homeâ there until they could erect a proper house. After that, the structure served them as a barn.\r\n\r\n<p>Later, on June 20, 1892, a William D. McDonald opened up the very first U.S. Post Office located in the remote northern portion of the Olympic Peninsula. The McDonald Post Office was located at a site 10 miles southwest of Port Angeles, and on the east side of the Elwha River. It was located in a large roofed stump. In time the house was sold, moved, renamed the Elwha Post Office. Today the aging icon still stands.\r\n\r\n<p>But the most famous of all local stump houses was one located on the Lennstrom family's property in Snohomish County's Stillaguamish Valley, in the tiny community of Edgecomb, which is currently a neighborhood within the old logging and railroad town of Arlington.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cedar_stump_Post_Office_1-600x386.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" />\r\n\r\n<p>It was likely in 1901 that the first of many curious visitors toting a camera arrived and documented the stump house in photographs. The Northwest's famed photographer, Darius Kinsey (1869-1945), brought four cameras (of different formats) and took eight classic shots. Over the ensuing two decades they were marketed as postcards and stereoview cards and helped establish the stump house as a regional icon. Kinsey himself liked the stump house so well that by March 1902, he was using a small image of it on his company's business stationery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In 1903 the Skagit County Times newspaper up in Sedro-Woolley, Washington, offered this description of the stump-house: âInside it is one good-sized room, which is boarded up and neatly papered and made as comfortable as any apartment could possibly be made. The walls inside slant inward at the top, which gives one the impression rather that it is an upstairs room, otherwise it is not different from any other room.â </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazingly, a few of these stump houses still remain.\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you have a big old massive tree stump on your property and are looking for a new private space, get your tools ready. It took one guy 20 years to carve out his stump house!\r\n\r\n<p>[Via <a href=\"https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/02/seriously-stump-houses-were-a-thing/\">Vintage News</a>, which used text, with credit, from <a href=\"http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_Id=9658\">Historylink.org</a>]\r\n",
