Other Music was a hub of avant-garde culture both locally and via their phenomenal weekly newsletter reviewing new releases, from experimental electronica to post-punk indie to freaky psych reissues, and everywhere in between. Whenever I visited Manhattan, I made a beeline to Other Music, and loved hearing staff recommendations (and peeking at what other customers were buying).\r\n<P>\r\nâWe still do a ton of business â probably more than most stores in the country,â co-owner Josh Madell told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/arts/music/other-music-record-store-closing.html?_r=1&mc_cid=44f568c7b7&mc_eid=e08c8ebff8\">New York Times</a>. âItâs just the economics of it actually supporting us â we donât see a future in it. Weâre trying to step back before it becomes a nightmare.â\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><P>Business has dropped by half since the storeâs peak in 2000, when it did about $3.1 million in sales, said Chris Vanderloo, who founded the shop with Mr. Madell and Jeff Gibson after the three met as employees at the music spinoff of Kimâs Video in the early â90s. (Mr. Gibson left Other Musicâs day-to-day operations in 2001.)\r\n<P>\r\nRent, on the other hand, has more than doubled from the $6,000 a month the store paid in 1995, while its annual share of the buildingâs property tax bill has also increased with the local real estate market.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOther Music, I will miss you. <p>\r\n",

This year, that pace has accelerated. There have been at least 23 toddler-involved shootings since Jan. 1, compared with 18 over the same period last year.

States with lax ones see lots of toddler shootings; even states with high levels of gun violence in general see few toddler gun injuries when they enact such laws. The NRA <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/19991005/the-hidden-agenda-behind-gun-storage-la\">claims gun storage laws are an attack on individual liberty</a>, and it not only opposes them but <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2016/01/07/nra-says-it-will-sue-oakland-over-new-gun-laws\">sues city governments that enact them</a>.",

This was apparently an issue of individuals working on their own initiative rather than the result of corporate policy, but they <em>were</em> directed to squelch news about Facebook itself and to manually inject \"missing\" stories into the trending topics.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>These new allegations emerged after Gizmodo last week revealed details about the inner workings of Facebookâs trending news teamâa small group of young journalists, primarily educated at Ivy League or private East Coast universities, who curate the âtrendingâ module on the upper-right-hand corner of the site. As we reported last week, curators have access to a ranked list of trending topics surfaced by Facebookâs algorithm, which prioritizes the stories that should be shown to Facebook users in the trending section. The curators write headlines and summaries of each topic, and include links to news sites. The section, which launched in 2014, constitutes some of the most powerful real estate on the internet and helps dictate what news Facebookâs usersâ167 million in the US aloneâare reading at any given moment.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Facebook's \"trending\" stuff comes out of a newsroom-like culture, with editorial direction and values. Which would be fine, except for the fact that Facebook claims that its trending topics are an organic or algorithmic representation of user interests and activities. Other Facebook curators Gizmodo spoke to denied that they suppressed conservative viewpoints, and \"we were unable to determine if left-wing news topics or sources were similarly suppressed.\"\r\n\r\n<p>Managers also instructed them to insert stories that were not trending despite being in the news; the Charlie Hebdo attacks, for instance, failed to trend on Facebook until it was artificially promoted, according to Gizmodo's source."

Avoid that uncertainty with the FIXD Active Car Health Monitor, now </span><a href=\"https://store.boingboing.net/sales/fixd-active-car-health-monitor?utm_source=boingboing.net&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fixd-active-car-health-monitor_050916\">just $38.95</span></a> in the Boing Boing Store.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXD is a small sensor that plugs easily into practically any vehicle manufactured after 1996. Once it syncs via Bluetooth to your smartphone, FIXD can assess any check engine light that pops up, then translate it into simple terms for non-gearheads to tell you exactly how seriously you need to take your car problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than worrying about your vehicleâs safety or a huge mechanicâs bill, FIXD will ease your anxiety by letting you know whatâll happen if you keep driving with the problem and what repairs need to happen to get your car or truck back in tip-top shape. FIXD can even turn off your check engine light, a procedure that previously could only be handled by an auto repair professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even without concerning warning lights, FIXD keeps helping, tracking and alerting you when your vehicle needs scheduled maintenance. This unit also lets you remotely monitor all your family vehicles so youâll always have peace of mind knowing the wife and kids are all driving safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get the FIXD Active Car Health Monitor now at </span><a href=\"https://store.boingboing.net/sales/fixd-active-car-health-monitor?utm_source=boingboing.net&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fixd-active-car-health-monitor_050916\">20% off</span></a> its regular price.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKNiNPEwjD4&w=560&h=315]</span></p>",
